                    articleSummary: Fair lending ensures that lenders do not discriminate based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, or disability when offering residential mortgage loans, guaranteeing equal opportunities for all. The Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity enforces the federal Fair Housing Act, with state and local agencies ensuring similar protections. Additional laws, such as the Equal Credit Opportunities Act, also safeguard your rights. For more information, visit the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development website.

                    articleSummary: Fair lending ensures that lenders do not discriminate based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, or disability when offering residential mortgage loans, guaranteeing equal opportunities for all. The Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity enforces the federal Fair Housing Act, with state and local agencies ensuring similar protections. Additional laws, such as the Equal Credit Opportunities Act, also safeguard your rights. For more information, visit the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development website.

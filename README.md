## Summary

eGain Portal, Retrieve, Search, Answers APIs: Enterprise knowledge APIs for managing portals, searching content, retrieving AI-powered answers, and accessing content chunks for custom integrations.
<!-- End Summary [summary] -->

### What is the eGain MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) server exposes eGain knowledge APIs to MCP‚Äëenabled clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.). It unifies semantic search, chunk retrieval, and Certified/Generative Answers so you can access your knowledge base directly from AI tools.

- What it can do:
  - Use tools like `getPortals`, `getPopularArticles`, `querySearch`, `queryRetrieve`, and `queryAnswers`
  - Return Certified/Generative answers with references and scores, or raw chunks for RAG
  - Enforce portal permissions with secure, token‚Äëbased access

## Development

Run locally without a published npm package:
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run build`
4. Run `node ./bin/mcp-server.js start --api-domain "..." --access-token "..."`

To use this local version with Cursor, Claude or other MCP Clients, you'll need to add the following config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "EgainMcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "./bin/mcp-server.js",
        "start",
        "--api-domain",
        "...",
        "--access-token",
        "..."
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This is my recommended method of using MCP. Claude and Cursor are the easiest to work with and are very MCP friendly. It is also recommended you omit the  `--access-token` flag and follow the steps for [Authentication](#authentication) to setup smart authentication.

To debug the MCP server locally, use the official MCP Inspector: 

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node ./bin/mcp-server.js start --api-domain "..." --access-token "..."
```

## Authentication

If you omit the `--access-token` flag, the server will use the interactive authentication flow. This requires a fully configured `.env` file in your project root.

Place a `.env` file with the following keys (values are examples/placeholders):

```
EGAIN_ENVIRONMENT_URL="https://your-tenant.knowledge.ai"
EGAIN_CLIENT_ID="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
EGAIN_REDIRECT_URI="https://oauth.pstmn.io/v1/callback"
AUTH_URL="https://your-tenant.b2clogin.com/your-tenant.onmicrosoft.com/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?p=B2C_1_signin"
ACCESS_URL="https://your-tenant.b2clogin.com/your-tenant.onmicrosoft.com/oauth2/v2.0/token?p=B2C_1_signin"
EGAIN_SCOPE_PREFIX="https://your-tenant.scope.prefixvalue.com"
```

Notes:
- If `--access-token` is provided (or `EGAIN_MCP_ACCESS_TOKEN` is set), that token is used directly and the `.env` is not required.
- Without `--access-token`, you must provide all required `.env` values above for authentication to occur. The flow will open a browser window, and a bearer token will be saved locally for reuse.
- **`EGAIN_CLIENT_SECRET`**: This field is included in the configuration but is not technically required for the authentication flow to work. You can leave it as an empty string if not needed.
- **`EGAIN_SCOPE_PREFIX`**: This is not required for Rigel setups. You can omit this or leave it as an empty string for Rigel environments.
- If you install via the DXT (Desktop Extension) file instead of configuring with a JSON `mcpServers` entry, a local `.env` file will not be read because `.env` files are excluded from the packaged extension. You must provide the required access token from within Claude Desktop Extensions settings.

### Required API permissions
Ensure your client app (and issued token) has the following API permissions:
- `knowledge.portalmgr.manage`
- `knowledge.portalmgr.read`
- `core.aiservices.read`

For more details on eGain authentication, see [eGain Authentication Guide](https://apidev.egain.com/developer-portal/get-started/authentication_guide/).

### Platform prerequisites
This MCP surfaces existing eGain APIs. If your tenant does not have required services provisioned or data available, related tools will not function:
- AI Services (Search/Retrieve/Answers) require AI indexing to be enabled and content indexed. Without an index, `querySearch`, `queryRetrieve`, and `queryAnswers` will fail or return empty results.
- Knowledge Portal Manager endpoints require a Knowledge Base and at least one portal with accessible content. Without this, `getPortals`, `getPopularArticles`, `getAnnouncements`, and `getArticle` will not return data.
If you‚Äôre unsure about your tenant‚Äôs setup, consult your eGain admin to confirm provisioning and access.

If you want to force a fresh login or clear local token data without waiting for token expiry, you can run the helper scripts:

```bash
# Force login (interactive OAuth flow)
node ./scripts/login.js

# Force logout (clears saved token files)
node ./scripts/logout.js
```

## Installation

<details>
<summary>DXT (Desktop Extension)</summary>

Install the MCP server as a Desktop Extension using the pre-built [`mcp-server.dxt`](./mcp-server.dxt) file:

Simply drag and drop the [`mcp-server.dxt`](./mcp-server.dxt) file onto Claude Desktop to install the extension.

The DXT package includes the MCP server and all necessary configuration. Once installed, the server will be available without additional setup.

> [!NOTE]
> DXT (Desktop Extensions) provide a streamlined way to package and distribute MCP servers. Learn more about [Desktop Extensions](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/desktop-extensions).

      "description": "Get All Portals Accessible To User\n\nGet All Portals Accessible to User\n\n## Overview\nThe Get All Portals Accessible to User API allows a user to fetch all portals accessible to the user across all departments.\n- If no access tags are specified for a portal, any user can access the portal.\n- If access tags are specified for a portal, users with a user profile that allows access can access the portal. For users with multiple user profiles, the user profile that allows access does not need to be the active user profile.\n- Global users (partition) cannot be assigned user profiles; their access is limited to portals without access restrictions.\n- The only articles returned are associated to an Article type when the parameter “Include in browse on portals” is set to \"Yes\".\n- When the \\`shortUrlTemplate\\` query parameter is provided, the API filters accessible portals according to the specified language and template name. A portal short URL specific to the \\`shortUrlTemplate\\` value is returned in the response when available. If there is no short URL for a language, the portal object returns an empty \\`shortURL\\` field.\n\n## Pagination behavior (CRITICAL for AI assistants)\n\n**IMPORTANT**: This endpoint is paginated. When searching for a portal by name or listing portals, you MUST automatically fetch ALL pages before concluding that a portal doesn't exist.\n\n### Automatic pagination is REQUIRED when:\n- User asks to find a portal by name (e.g., \"business portal\", \"Master portal\")\n- User requests to list or see all portals\n- You need to resolve a natural portal name to its ID\n\n### How to detect more pages exist:\nThe response includes \\`paginationInfo\\` with:\n- \\`count\\`: Total number of items across all pages\n- \\`pagenum\\`: Current page number\n- \\`pagesize\\`: Items per page (default: 25)\n\n**Check for more pages if ANY of these are true:**\n1. The number of portals returned equals \\`pagesize\\` (e.g., exactly 25 portals returned)\n2. \\`paginationInfo.count > (pagenum * pagesize)\\` - there are more items beyond this page\n3. The response includes a \\`link\\` array with a \\`next\\` relation\n\n### Required pagination workflow:\n1. Start with \\`$pagenum=1\\` and \\`$pagesize=25\\` (default)\n2. After receiving the response, check \\`paginationInfo\\`\n3. **If more pages exist** (using the checks above), automatically call this endpoint again with \\`$pagenum=2\\`, then \\`$pagenum=3\\`, etc.\n4. Continue incrementing \\`$pagenum\\` until:\n   - A page returns fewer portals than \\`pagesize\\` (indicating the last page)\n   - A page returns zero portals\n   - \\`pagenum * pagesize >= paginationInfo.count\\` (if count represents total items)\n5. Merge all portals from all pages by unique portal ID\n6. Only then search through the complete merged list or report results to the user\n\n### Example scenario:\nIf you search for \"business portal\" and the first page returns 25 portals but none match:\n- DO NOT immediately tell the user the portal doesn't exist\n- Check \\`paginationInfo.count\\` - if it's > 25, automatically fetch page 2\n- Continue fetching until all pages are retrieved\n- Search the complete merged list before concluding the portal doesn't exist\n\nThis ensures reliable portal name-to-ID resolution and prevents false \"not found\" errors.\n"
